	* Featured image
	* Images within post content
	* Tags
	* Categories. (If the category doesn't exist in the destination site then the category is created and assigned to the post)
	* Taxonomy terms. (make sure taxonomy is also registered on your destination site).
	* Parent and child relationships (must use batch duplication option to achieve this).
	* ACF Fields
	* ACF Field Groups (sync field groups within your network!)

	* Choose to ignore specific post meta keys in the duplication process

*	Developers
	* Create your own addons! Multisite Post Duplicator is now fully extendable. Create your own functionality. Check out the API [documentation](http://www.wpmaz.uk/mpddocs/).
	* Check out a list of hooks you can use (http://www.wpmaz.uk/multisite-post-duplicator-actions-and-filters/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this only work on a multisite network? =

Yes.

= Can I copy custom post types? =

Yes.

= What about post meta? Will these be copied over? =

Yes.

= Does this work with advanced custom fields? =

Yes. However, you have to have the same custom fields defined in each of the sites on your network. To help keep the fields in sync try: https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-multisite-sync/

= What about Multisites on Subdomain Configurations? =

Unfortunately we don't support sub domain configuations at this time. You may use it to some extent, but a lot of this plugins features may produce unexpected results. Our plan is to introduce support for this in the near futute.
