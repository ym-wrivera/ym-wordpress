><strong>Support Details:</strong> We are happy to provide support and help troubleshoot issues. Visit our Contact page at <a href="http://serverpress.com/contact/" target="_blank">http://serverpress.com/contact/</a>. Users should know however, that we check the WordPress.org support forums once a week on Wednesdays from 6pm to 8pm PST (UTC -8).

The <em>WPSiteSync for Content</em> plugin was specifically designed to ease your workflow when creating content between development, staging and live servers. The tool removes the need to migrate an entire database, potentially overwriting new content on the live site, just to update a few pages or posts. Now you can easily move your content from one install to another with the click of a button, reducing errors and saving you time.

WPSiteSync for Content is fully functional in any WordPress environment.  We recommend using DesktopServer, but it is not a requirement.

* Real-Time LIVE Sync eliminates data loss such as Comments.
* Saving development time with No files to backup, download and upload.
* Limit mistakes copying and pasting.

== Installation ==

Installation instructions: To install, do the following:

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --&gt; Add New.
2. Select the "Upload Plugin" button.
3. Click on the "Choose File" button to upload your file.
3. When the Open dialog appears select the wpsitesynccontent.zip file from your desktop.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait until the upload is complete.
5. When finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A confirmation message will be displayed.

or, you can upload the files directly to your server.

1. Upload all of the files in `wpsitesynccontent.zip` to your  `/wp-content/plugins/wpsitesynccontent` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will need to Install and Activate the WPSiteSync for Content plugin on your development website (the Source) as well as the Target web site (where the Content is being moved to).

Once activated, you can use the Configuration page found at Settings -&gt; WPSiteSync, on the Source website to set the URL of the Target and the login credentials to use when sending data. This will allow the WPSiteSync for Content plugin to communicate with the Target website, authenticate, and then move the data between the websites. You do not need to Configure WPSiteSync for Content on the Target website as this will only be receiving Synchronization requests from the Source site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to Install WPSiteSync for Content on both sites? =

Yes! The WPSiteSync for Content needs to be installed on the local or Staging server (the website you're moving the data from - the Source), as well as the Live server (the website you're moving the data to - the Target).

= Does this plugin Synchronize all of my content at once? =

No. WPSiteSync for Content will only synchronize the Page or Post content that you are editing. And it will only Synchronize the content when you tell it to. This allows you to control exactly what content is moved between sites and when it will be moved.

= Will this overwrite data while I am editing? =

No. WPSiteSync checks to see if the Content is being edited by someone else on the Target web site. If it is, it will not update the Content, allowing you to coordinate with the users on the Target web site.

In addition, each time Content is updated or Synchronized on the Target web site, a Post Revision is created (using the Post Revision settings). This allows you to recover Content to a previous version.

= Does WPSiteSync only update Page and Posts Content? =

Yes. Support for Custom Post Types is coming very soon. Additional plugins for User Attribution, Synchronizing Comments and Pulling content are in the testing stage and will be released soon as well.

More complex data, such as WooCommerce products, Forms (like Gravity Forms or Ninja Forms), and other plugins that use custom database tables will be supported by additional plugins that work with those products.
